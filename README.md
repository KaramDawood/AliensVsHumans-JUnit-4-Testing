This is my implementation of CodeCademy's portfolio project for their intermediate Java course, also focusing on JUnit testing.

According to the requierements, I created a game where the player can choose his warrior (alien/human) to be sent to the battlefield. Before that, you can choose between customizing armor/weapons or healing/superpowers respectively. 
The battle itself is a loop that runs by itself until one of the warriors runs out of health and depending on what changes you made to armor/weapons or healing/superpowers you may win or lose!

For this project, I did follow the test driven development approach (test-first) so that my methods were working from the getgo before implementing them in the main method. 
All my tests (also the test suite combining all test classes) are included in the project files!

This project was done using Eclipse!
